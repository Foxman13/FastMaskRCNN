# Mask RCNN
Mask RCNN in TensorFlow

This repo attempts to reproduce this amazing work by Kaiming He et al. : 
[Mask R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870)

## Requirements

- [Tensorflow (>= 1.0.0)](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux)
- [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/INSTALL.rst.txt)
- [COCO dataset](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download)
- [Resnet50](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/resnet_v1_50_2016_08_28.tar.gz)

## How-to
1. Go to `./libs/datasets/pycocotools` and run `make`
2. Download [COCO](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download) dataset, place it into `./data`, then run `python download_and_convert_data.py` to build tf-records. It takes a while.
3. Download pretrained resnet50 model, `wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/resnet_v1_50_2016_08_28.tar.gz`, unzip it, place it into `./data/pretrained_models/`
4. Go to `./libs` and run `make`
5. run `python train/train.py` for training
6. There are certainly some bugs, please report them back, and let's solve them together.

## How-to (Windows) updated to Python 3.5 - totally experimental!!
### Environment Setup
1. [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/older-downloads/) with [Python Tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/PTVS)
2. [CUDA 8.0 Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
3. After CUDA is installed, set CUDAHOME in your System Environment Variables to the installation directory.

### Data prep and building dependencies
1. Go to `./libs/datasets/pycocotools` and run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
2. Download [COCO](http://mscoco.org/dataset/#download) dataset, place it into `./data`, then run `python download_and_convert_data.py` to build tf-records. It takes a while.
3. Download pretrained resnet50 model, `wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/resnet_v1_50_2016_08_28.tar.gz`, unzip it, place it into `./data/pretrained_models/`
5. Go to `./libs` and run `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`. The script will fail to build "nms_gpu". That's fine.
6. Open the file 'gpu_nms.cpp' that was generated by Cython and make the following edit to line 1879 - change the first parameter in "__Pyx_BufPtrStrided1d" type of "int *"
7. Go to the './libs/nms' directory and edit "build_nms.cmd". At the top are variables for paths to various folders required for building. Fill these paths in for your local system, save and close.
8. Go to command line and run "build_nms.cmd" - this generates gpu_nms.pyd from nms_kernel.cu and gpu_nms.cpp
9. run `python train/train.py` for training
